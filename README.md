# monthly_maturities_yield_curves
Python code to obtain mexican yield curves with monthly maturities

Info comes from Valmer's 'Curva Nominal "Zero"'. Information contains yield curves with daily maturities ranging from 1 to 10,920 days. The code here yields mexican yield curves with monthly maturities from 1 to 120 months, where 1 month is equal to 30.4375 days.

The input is the information for the yield curve observed at any given day.
